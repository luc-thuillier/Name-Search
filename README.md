This C++ program analyzes a set of data from an imported file. It reads the data from a txt file into a 2-D array and uses nested loops to find specific values. A function is used to calculate the average depth by passing the array as an argument. The program outputs the desired values to both the command prompt and an output file. Additionally, it operates within an endless loop that provides the option to break out and exit the program when desired.
